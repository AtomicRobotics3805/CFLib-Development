/**
 * This class is an example of a claw controlled by a single servo. Its first two commands, open and close, which each
 * move the claw to the corresponding position. The third command, switch, opens it if it's closed and closes it if it's
 * open. The switch command is particularly useful during TeleOp.
 * If you want, you can also use this class for other mechanisms that also involve one servo, like a delivery bucket.
 * To use this class, copy it into the proper package and change the four constants.
